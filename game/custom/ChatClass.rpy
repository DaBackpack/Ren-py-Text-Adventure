  ## PRECONDITION: each chat must have at least three questions
  ## NOTE: we're going to need to grab getQuestions() and concatenate it
  ##       to $expected in order to validate user inputs... Christ.

  ## NOTE: a question has key 'entry', corresponding to the user input
  ##       a follow-up question to that question has key 'entry<X>'
  ##       e.g. 'entry' = 'JOKE', follow-ups are 'entry2, entry3'

    # asked:     LIST containing 'entry's of questions already asked

    #           first element is a follow-up, if relevant
    #           other elements are available questions
