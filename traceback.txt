I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/chats/c_1014.rpy", line 41, in script
    $desc = "You are now chatting with '{color=#ff1493}" + targetname + "{/color}'.  In these chats, you will be given a list of options for questions you can pose, prefixed by a tag.  Enter the tag of the conversation option you wish to pursue.\n\n" + target.questionFormat()
  File "game/chats/c_1014.rpy", line 41, in <module>
    $desc = "You are now chatting with '{color=#ff1493}" + targetname + "{/color}'.  In these chats, you will be given a list of options for questions you can pose, prefixed by a tag.  Enter the tag of the conversation option you wish to pursue.\n\n" + target.questionFormat()
